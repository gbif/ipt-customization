# ipt-customizations

This project serves as a repository for more complicated customizations of the [Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](http://www.gbif.org/ipt) with alternative freemarker, css, image, and js files. 

Each customizations is specific to a version of the IPT. For example, [canadensys_v205](canadensys_v205) is a customization the [Canadensys IPT](http://data.canadensys.net/ipt/) uses specific to version 2.0.5. For instructions on how to use it, refer to the [Readme file](canadensys_v205/README.md) file inside each directory.

For simple customizations, please refer to this [IPT2 Customization  wiki page](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/IPT2Customization.wiki).
