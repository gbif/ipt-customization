ipt-customizations
==================

Customize the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](http://www.gbif.org)'s [Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](http://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/) v. 2.0.5 with alternative freemarker, css, and js. 

These patch is specific to IPT 2.0.5. 

This patch is based on the [Canadensys work](https://github.com/Canadensys/ipt-customization), but the patch is designed to apply to the IPT source tree, and not the final war.
